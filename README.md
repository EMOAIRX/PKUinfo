# PKUINFO Readme

## Project Overview
**PKUINFO** is a platform designed to provide activity information and consulting services for students at Peking University. The project aims to aggregate data from various sources using web scraping and other methods. It then utilizes Linked Data and Knowledge Graph techniques to integrate, store, and format the collected data. The platform offers free access to activity information for students within the university, allowing them to sort and filter the information based on criteria such as time and other preferences.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main directories:

1. **front:** This directory contains the Vue.js frontend application.
2. **back:** Here lies the Spring Boot backend implementation.
3. **pyprocessor:** In this directory, you'll find the Python scripts responsible for gathering and consolidating information.

## TODO List
There are several features and improvements planned for PKUINFO:

1. **Backend Support for URL Upload:** Enable backend functionality to process information from URLs uploaded by users. This will involve utilizing Python scripts to handle the information.

FILE pyprocessor/get_url.py exists something wrong, but it doesn't matters.

2. **Automated Public Account Information Retrieval:** Implement an automated process to fetch data from public accounts or sources. The data collected will be integrated into the backend server to augment the existing content.

3. **User Feedback and Management System:** Create a backend system that allows users to provide feedback on activities and events. This system will facilitate the efficient management and response to user suggestions.

4. **Natural Language Interactive Filtering:** Enhance the user experience by introducing natural language processing capabilities. This will allow users to interactively filter activity information using human language commands.
